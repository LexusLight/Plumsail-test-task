Implement a widget that displays the weather in the specified cities.
Get data for the widget from free public API. You must register an account at OpenWeather.
After clicking the ‘Gear’ button at the upper-right corner, switch the view.
A user must be able to:
* Remove previously added cities.
* Reorder the cities by dragging and dropping them within the list using ‘Hamburger’ icon to the left from the city name.
* Add new locations.
Save the configuration in the local storage and restore it on future visits. A user should be able to configure the widget just once and then have the same view until they change the computer or clean the storage.
By default, on initial opening, request the current user’s location and display the weather in their city.
